1. **Farming:**
   - Farming SovietDex can lead to blacklisting. Farming involves creating servers, inviting the bot to them, and spamming or sending messages every 3 or 4 hours to acquire more Soviets.

2. **Cross Trading:** 
   - Selling or trading Soviets for money, bitcoin, or any other form of currency, as well as establishing a cross-trading market, will result in blacklisting from the bot.

3. **Multiple Accounts:**
   - Using multiple accounts to create servers, sending messages every 4-5 hours solely to acquire more Soviets, and then transferring them to your main account will result in blacklisting. Even if you don't transfer them to your main account, you will still be blacklisted.

4. **Liability:** 
   - The SovietDex team is not liable for any loss, damage, or inconvenience caused by the use of the bot. Use the bot at your own risk.

5. **Reporting Violations:**
   - If you witness any violations of these terms and rules, please report them to the bot administrators or moderators. Failure to do so may result in possible action, including but not limited to blacklisting.

6. **Moderation:**
   - The admins and moderators of the bot have the authority to enforce these rules and take action against violators. This may include warnings, bans, permanent bans, blacklisting, or permanent blacklisting.

   - Violators of these rules may have their items deleted or be subject to the removal of such items.


Failure to comply with these rules may result in a permanent blacklist. Additionally, repeated violations of the bot's rules can lead to both a blacklist and a permanent ban from the server and support server.
